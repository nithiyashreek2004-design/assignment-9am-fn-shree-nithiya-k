<!-- What is asynchronous JavaScript? Why is it needed? 
 Asynchronous JavaScript allows the program to start a task and continue executing other code 
 without waiting for that task to finish. It is needed to improve performance and responsiveness, 
 especially for operations that take time, like network requests or file I/O. -->

 <!-- Explain callback functions with a real-life example? 
    callback is function inside a function   
 ex:i will call you back after my work is done {or}ordering food in restaurant 
-->
 
<!-- What is callback hell? Why is it a problem? 
     callback hell: callback functions nested within other callback functions
     problem: makes code hard to read.debug and maintain   
-->

<!-- Difference between callbacks and promises.
  callback : function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later
  promise : object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
  {Callback:“Here is my function, call it later”
   Promise:“Here is my promise, I’ll give result later”}
-->

<!-- Define a Promise and explain its states?
 The Promise Object represents the completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its results.
 it has three states:
 1. Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
-->

<!-- Why is async/await preferred over .then()? 
 then is an chaining method for handling promises, which can lead to nested structures and harder-to-read code.
 async/await provides a cleaner and more readable syntax for working with promises, making asynchronous code look
-->

<!-- Can await be used without async? Why? 
    No, await cannot be used without async because await is designed to work within async functions. 
    Using await outside of an async function will result in a syntax error.
-->

<!-- What happens if a promise is rejected?
 reject: A function to reject the promise with a reason (error)
-->

<!-- Explain error handling in async/await.
    Error handling in async/await is typically done using try...catch blocks. 
    When an asynchronous operation that returns a promise is awaited, 
    if the promise is rejected, the control is transferred to the catch block where the error can be handled appropriately.
-->

<!-- Write one real-world use case for asynchronous JavaScript 
    Real-world use case: Fetching data from a remote server (e.g., loading user profiles, product details, etc.) 
    without blocking the main thread, allowing the application to remain responsive to user interactions.
