    <h2> Favorite hobby</h2>
    <ul>*paint*</ul>
    <p>"Painting has always been a source of inspiration and creativity for me. As a tech professional, I find that the process of painting mirrors the art of codingâ€”both require patience, and a vision for the final outcome.
         Just as a painter blends colors to create a masterpiece I enjoy blending design and functionality to craft beautiful and user-friendly web applications."</p>
    <ul>*Being alone*</ul>
    <p>"Being alone allows me to recharge and reflect. It gives me the space to think creatively, set goals, and focus on personal growth. Solitude is where I find clarity and inspiration."</p>
