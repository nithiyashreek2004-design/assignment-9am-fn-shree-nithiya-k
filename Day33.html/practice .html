<!-- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
 particularly single-page applications where you can create reusable UI components. 

 React helps us update only the part of the page that changes not the whole page.
 Real time example: (instagram)
        1. you like some post.
        2. only the like count changes.
        3. page does not reload. 


advantages of react:
        1.component Reusability
        ex : all button components like login,signup,etc..

        2.Virtual DOM(fast performance)
        ex : only changed part not whole part like chat app, new message arrives,only chat list updates.

        3.easy to maintain (code is clean,organized,and readable).
        ex : code is clean,organized,and readable,one file for navbar,one file for product cart,etc...
             if bug in product  -> fix only that file.

   SPA(single page application):
        SPA loads only one html page and updates content dynamically without reloading the page.
        ex : old website -> click link --page reload 
             spa website -> click link --page does not reload js updates the content.
        Real time exmple: TV remote (screen stays ON only channel changes)


Difference between React and JavaScript:
        js:
           1.programming language.
           2.controls + DOM.
           3.manual DOM updates.
           4.more code.
        react:
           1.js library.
           2.builds UI using js.
           3.automatic updates.
           4.less code.
           
virtual dom:
       virtual dom is a lightweight copy of the real dom 
       that react uses to decide what needs to change.           

       ex:  making changes in rough notebook
            compare with original 
            update only changed lines(notebook=virtual DOM,final document=Real DOM)
