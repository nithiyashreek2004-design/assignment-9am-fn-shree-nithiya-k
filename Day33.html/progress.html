<!-- Break existing HTML project into components
Identify reusable UI blocks
Prepare mindset for JSX and props
Set foundation for React setup (Day 34)
Smooth transition from JS to React -->

<!-- reusable UI blocks/components in html project
    1.header
    2.navbar
    3.product cart or main content
    4.footer
    5.sidebar
    6.buttons
 
    
  jsx:  
     jsx is mixes of HTML+JS 
    One parent element
    Use {} for JavaScript
    class → className

  props:
     props is used to pass data from one component to another component
     props is read only (cannot be modified inside the component)
     props is used to make components reusable with different data
     ex: button component with different text like login,signup,submit

foundation for react setup:
        1.nodejs installation
        2.npm(node package manager)
        3.create react app(command:npx create-react-app appname)
        4.folder structure
        5.starting the app(command: npm start)

smooth transition from js to react:
        1.understand components
        2.jsx syntax
        3.props for data passing
        4.hooks for state management and lifecycle methods
        5.event handling in react
        6.conditional rendering and lists
